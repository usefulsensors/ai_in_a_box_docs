# AI in a Box Documentation

Your very own private AI that you can ask questions and get answers, all in a 
tiny box! The first AI that you can talk to, and that talks back, running
locally with no internet connection so your conversations and data are
completely secure. No account, setup, or subscription are needed, just plug in
the box and start chatting.

## Getting Started

The simplest way to begin with AI in a Box is to [buy a pre-assembled device from Crowd Supply](https://usfl.ink/cs).
This gives you a system that boots into caption mode right after you plug it 
in. Initial orders are expected to be delivered in January 2024.

Before that date we'll be sharing the software needed to run the box on GitHub,
but as a small startup we'll only be able to offer best-effort support. This
document has details on the software and hardware we're using.

## Software

AI in a Box integrates a lot of different open source software frameworks and
ML models, and we are open sourced our own code that orchestrate and optimize
all of these components.

boards:
